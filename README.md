## Hello, I'm Pierre!
I am currently a fourth year computer engineering student at Polytechnic University of the Philippines - Manila. I currently specialize on Big Data Analytics but I venture out sometimes into other fields such as networks and cybersecurity. As of now:
- I use SQL for data querying
- I use the knowledge from SQL and slowly incorporating Pandas
- Reviews Python and;
- Also studying Microsoft Excel
