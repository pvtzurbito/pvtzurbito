## Hello, I'm Pierre!
I am currently a fourth year computer engineering student at Polytechnic University of the Philippines - Manila. I currently specialize on Big Data Analytics but I venture out sometimes into other fields such as networks and cybersecurity. As of now:
- 💾 I use SQL to create relational database queries,
- 🐼 I use the knowledge from SQL and slowly incorporating Pandas,
- 🐍 Reviews Python and;
- 📊 Also studying Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets!
